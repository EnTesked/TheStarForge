"With the rise of the Unbound, the corporation GAIA decided to create modulable weapon parts for combat rifles. This way citizen looking to protect themselves from rising threats such as the Unbound now have the possibility to purchase a weapon perfectly fitting their needs.",

"Slow firing, long range, many pellets, strong knockback, you could personalise them to how you see fit. This attracted a lot of customers to GAIA, a company previously focused on nanite and other very high-tech technologies. But this didn't only attract customers, other space corporations started to produce their own modulable parts to add to the GAIA collection.",

"Elpis, Xenotox, Vitrium, Pachinko, many started to add their parts to the market. Even the Unbound started to sell some, whether they are trying to humor us, or simply jump on the market increasing in popularity is unknown. One thing's for sure, the current ongoing wars gave birth to a new very versatile type of weapon."
